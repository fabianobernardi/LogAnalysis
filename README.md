# LogAnalysis
[Udacity] Database log analysis project


# Requirements
This project was created using Python 3, so you should have Python 3 (3.6 
minimum) installed on your machine to run this script.

It is also necessary to have the virtual machine with the database referring 
to the project.
The code in this project was designed to run exclusively within the Vagrant 
virtual machine.


# Usage
Copy the files or make a clone of the repository into a directory visible by 
the virtual machine.

Cloning the repository:
> git clone https://github.com/fabianobernardi/LogAnalysis.git

Access the project root directory and run the log_analysis.py file:
> python3 log_analysis.py

The script will display the result on the screen and save to a file named 
result.txt, in the same directory as the script.
